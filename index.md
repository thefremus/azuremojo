# Dev Mojo

## Introduction

The purpose of this particular repository is to keep track of my learning. I want to keep a journal/log style record of the things I read or watch. I often find myself reading articles or watching video without enough cognisance of what I actually just saw. I feel at times there is a need to take things a bit slower - giving yourself the time to understand the topic at hand. I find myself rushing through an article or video too often. Getting to the end result prematurely often leaves me disatisfied. If you take the time - it doesn't matter how long either - to learn about something is a better approach. I think the reason we prematurely get to the endpoint too quickly is possibly a lack of consistency. A commitment to consistency over a period of time will lead to a better outcome in the long term. 

## Full Stack Software Engineering

Not sure if Full Stack Software Engineering is a thing or not. Either way software engineering as a practice covers certain disciplines. You can build a front-end using web technologies such as Angular or React. You could also build a front-end for mobile or desktop using technologies such as Xamarin. The majority of front-end applications integrate with a backend. A backend can be something such as an RESTful API. A RESTful API exposes HTTP endpoints. The backend itself also typically connects to a data persistence technology such as SQL Server. In addition to the afforementioned areas most applications are run in the cloud. Cloud computing is an area of focus in its own right - I see it as something separate. 

## Sources of learning

I have been asked in many interviews how I remain up-to-date on the latest trends. The latest trends are not always the best thing for me in the moment. Sometimes even the "older" things remain relevant. Many software engineering books written 20 or more years ago provide very relevant learning for today. To me it feels like focusing on achieving consistency is more relevant. It is important to know about the newer ways of doing things - often they build on the older ways too though. In saying I find several ways of learning to be extremely useful.

1. Reading code from repositories
2. Watching video material
3. Reading books
4. Writing your own code
