# Styling your .NET MAUI App

## It all starts somewhere

So I want to write a small application using .NET MAUI. The application will run on Windows - I'm not going down the road of getting it to run on Android as yet. I personally feel a .NET MAUI app can be a replacement for a WinForms application. Why not right? So my idea for an application is to capture transaction details from my trips to the shop. I think it could be interesting to build up a dataset of shopping trips over an extended period of time. 

So to start I'll create two pages in my .NET MAUI app - a transaction list page as well as a page to capture the transactions.

The purpose of the application is to learn about the features of .NET MAUI. Specifically about the styling. I would like to understand the basic syntax of the styling. Styling refers to the font, colours and general appearance of elements in the application.
