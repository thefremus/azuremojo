# A perspective on mapping objects in .NET

## Introduction

Most or many of the projects I have worked on in the past have predominantly used AutoMapper for object mapping. AutoMapper is a very popular .NET library used to map objects in your application. But first lets try to understand the basic idea. Many .NET projects use an ORM, such as EFCore, to map objects to database tables. The objects mapping to your database is typically referred to as entity classes - or just entities. In most .NET projects the persistence of data lives in a different abstraction layer to the rest of your application. Entity classes are usually transformed into other classes. The transformed classes are used to render data in an API endpoint, for instance. The transformed classes can have similar properties - or not at all. You might have an entity class of type `Person` with a `FirstName` and `LastName` property. The entity class maps to a table in your database - `People`. The table contains columns for `FirstName` and `LastName`. When you expose a list of people to an API endpoint you might display a `FullName`. The `FullName` property could be a concatenation of the `FirstName` and `LastName` properties. But typically you would then have a entity class `Person` mapping to a "presentation class" `PersonDTO`. You have two choices when it comes to mapping - you can do it manually or you can let a mapping library such as AutoMapper do it for you. I am not in either camp. I think both approaches work depending on your scenario. The focus will be on one mapping library - Mapster.

After watching [Mapster, the best .NET mapper that you are (probably) not using](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIslFVEHkzA) and reading [Enjoy Using Mapster in .Net 6](https://medium.com/@M-S-2/enjoy-using-mapster-in-net-6-2d3f287a0989) I felt the need to explore the world of mapping for myself. To be honest up to this point I have only seen mapping as a necessary evil - in the projects I worked on I keep using them where they are used. In some cases though I use manual mapping, especially when writing projections from an EF Core DbContext. The thing that struck me most in the video is the performance gains - the difference in performance compared to manual mapping seems to make it worth considering. 

So to get going I am going to create a small project - with a test project, and a class library. The goal is to get to the heart of the functionality - but to understand what is happening as well.
