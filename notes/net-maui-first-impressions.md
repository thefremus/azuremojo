# .NET MAUI - My first impressions

I know very little about desktop or as they like to call it these days native application development. In my career so far I have mostly been involved in writing backend API services consumed by browser-based front-ends. So my view on desktop development in the .NET realm might be skewed. Nevertheless it is an area I have always wanted to explore even though the focus in my day-to-day work has been on the browser side of things. The last time, before my current job, I touched any form of .NET application development focusing on desktop was in 2016. I was involved in a project using a WinForms application. To be brutally honest WinForms development is something I have pretty much avoided - but why? I think it stems from the clunkiness - heaviness of WinForms development. From the heaviness of the designer to the change in mindset. I always got the impression WinForms code was very singleton oriented. Like in the project I worked on at the time everything in the application was a singleton. Static classes everywhere. I'm not saying it is wrong - but if you have worked with .NET Core it just feels different. I only started working on .NET Core 1.0 in 2017 - but at the time I also found the ASP.NET Framework to be "better" in many ways. The way I have been developing systems for the last while separated the UI development from the backend development. Typically you would develop your backend using ASP.NET WebApi. The frontend would then be developed using a framework such as Angular. The separation felt clear - you do backend (C#) code in Visual Studio. And frontend development using VSCode. The two disciplines required a different hat - you switch context if you will. JavaScript has a different mindset with its own nuances. It feels a lot different to coding a backend C# service. 

I always viewed WinForms as a tool for creating a quick and dirty utility app to make the management of something easier. In some cases it makes sense to have a little standalone app performing a specific function. In a sense its easier to whip up a WinForms app. Doing something similar in say an Angular app requires a lot more ceremony. With Angular you have to first create a component, a service, hook it up to an API endpoint etc. With a WinForms app you can basically just start writing some C# code to perform a specific task. Utility WinForm apps do not always go into production. 

In 2022 I was exposed to WinForms development again - it feels very painful and clunky. Maybe I'm wrong but the designer for WinForms fills me with a sense of dread. I also find state management in WinForms a mystery. You can either do it "right" using an MVVM pattern or do it "wrong" placing events and things in the code-behind. I guess at the end of the day it matters very little - its the customer who drives the business. They care very little about the technology being used. 

Back to the topic at hand - .NET MAUI. When I saw or heard (or read) about .NET MAUI the first time I saw it as an opportunity to learn XAML. You see I was one of those people who skipped XAML (WPF). I skipped it because it felt as if WPF was or is a rabbit hole of note. It always felt a lot more complex than WinForms. So when .NET MAUI surfaced I felt it was an opportunity to do a reset on my XAML skills. I also skipped the entire Xamarin development experience. 

Nothing in life is permanent - technologies come and go. Learning .NET MAUI today might not result in me using it on a fulltime basis - but I might learn something. In the vain of learning something I completed the modules on [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/build-apps-with-dotnet-maui/). Reflecting back on the learning I want to look at the things I found the most interesting. 

To make the process a bit more interesting I am going to be writing some code - creating a .NET MAUI app from scratch.
